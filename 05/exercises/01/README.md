### Exercise 5.01
The following program fragments illustrate the relational and equality
operators. Show the output produced by each, assuming that `i`, `j`, and `k` are
`int` variables.

```
(a) i = 2; j = 3;
    k = i * j == 6;
    printf("%d", k);
(b) i = 5; j = 10; k = 1;
    printf("%d", k > i < j);
(c) i = 3; j = 2; k = 1;
    printf("%d", i < j == j < k);
(d) i = 3; j = 4; k = 5;
    printf("%d", i % j + i < k);
```

### Solution

(a) 1  
(b) 1  
(c) 1  
(d) 0
