### Project 5.01
Write a program that calculates how many digits a number contains:

```
Enter a number: 374
The number 374 has 3 digits
```

You many assume that the number has no more than four digits. *Hint*: Use `if`
statements to test the number. For example, if the number is between 0 and 9, it
has one digit. If the number is between 10 and 99, it has two digits.

### Solution
See `1.c`.
