### Project 5.10
Using the `switch` statement, write a program that converts a numerical grade
into a letter grade:

```
Enter numberical grade: 84
Letter grade: B
```

Use the following grading scale: A = 90-100, B = 80-89, C = 70-79, D = 60-69,
F = 0-59. Print an error message if the grade is larger than 100 or less than 0.
*Hint*: Break the grade into two digits, then use a `switch` statement to test
the ten's digit.

### Solution
See `10.c`.
