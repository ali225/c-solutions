### Project 5.05
In one state, single residents are subject to the following income tax:

| Income        | Amount of tax |                               |
| ------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Not over $750 | 1% of income  |
| $750-$2,250   | $7.50         | plus 2% of amount over $750   |
| $2,250-$3,750 | $37.50        | plus 3% of amount over $2,250 |
| $3,750-$5,250 | $82.50        | plus 4% of amount over $3,750 |
| $5,250-$7,000 | $142.50       | plus 5% of amount over $5,250 |
| Over $7,000   | $230.00       | plus 6% of amount over $7,000 |

Write a program that asks the user to enter the amount of taxable income, then
displays the tax due.
