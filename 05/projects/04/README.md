### Project 5.04
Here's a simplified version of the Beaufort scale, which is used to estimate
wind force:

| Speed (knots) | Description
| --- | --- |
| Less than 1 | Calm |
| 1-3 | Light air |
| 4-27 | Breeze |
| 28-47 | Gale |
| 48-63 | Storm |
| Above 63 | Hurricane |

Write a program that asks the user to enter a wind speed (in knots), then
displays the corresponding description.

### Solution 
See `4.c`.
