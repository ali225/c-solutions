### Project 22.17

Write a program that reads a series of phone numbers from a file and displays
them in a standard format. Each line of the file will contain a single phone
number, but the numbers may be in a variety of formats. You may assume that each
line contains 10 digits, possibly mixed with other characters (which should be
ignored). For example, suppose that the file contains the following lines:

```
404.817.6900
(215) 686-1776
312-746-6000
877 275 5273
6173434200
```

The output of the program should have the following appearance:

```
(404) 817-6900
(215) 686-1776
(312) 746-6000
(877) 275-5273
(617) 343-4200
```

Have the program obtain the file name from the command line.

### Solution

See `17.c`.
