### Project 22.11

Write a program that reads a date from the command line and displays it in the
following form:

```
September 13, 2010
```

Allow the user to enter the date as either `9-13-2010` or `9/13/2010`; you may
assume that there are no spaces in the date. Print an error message if the date
doesn't have one of the specified forms. *Hint:* Use `sscanf` to extract the
month, day and year from the command-line argument.

### Solution

See `11.c`.
