### Project 22.09

Write a program that merges two files containing part records stored by the
`inventory.c` program (see Programming Project 8). Assume that the records in
each file are sorted by part number, and that we want the resulting file to be
sorted as well. If both files have a part with the same number, combine the
quantities stored in the records (As a consistency check, have the program
compare the part names and print an error message if they don't match). Have the
program obtain the names of the input files and the merged file from the command
line.

### Solution

See `9.c`.
