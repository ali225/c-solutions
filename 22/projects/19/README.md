(a) Write a program that converts a Windows text file to a UNIX text file (See
Section 22.1 for a discussion of the differences between Windows and UNIX text
files).

(b) Write a program that converts a UNIX text file to a Windows text file.

In each case, have the program obtain the names of both files from the command
line. *Hint:* Open the input file in `"rb"` mode and the output file in`"wb"`
mode.
