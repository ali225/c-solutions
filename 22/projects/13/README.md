### Project 22.13

Modify Programming Project 8 from Chapter 5 so that the program obtains
departure and arrival times from a file named `flights.dat`. Each line of the
file will contain a departure time followed by an arrival time, with one or more
spaces separating the two. Times will be expressed using the 24-hour clock. For
example, here's what `flights.dat` might look like if it contained the flight
information listed in the original project:

```
8:00 10:16
9:43 11:52
11:19 13:31
12:47 15:00
14:00 16:08
15:45 17:55
19:00 12:20
21:45 23:58
```
