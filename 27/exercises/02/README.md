### Exercise 27.02

(C99) Write the parameterized macros `INT32_C(n)`, `UINT32_C(n)`, `INT64_C(n)`
and `UINT64_C(n)`, assuming that the `int` type and `long int` types are 32 bits
wide and the `long long int` type is 64 bits wide. *Hint:* Use the `##`
preprocessor operator to attach a suffix to `n` containing a combination of `L`
and/or `U` characters (See Section 7.1 for a discussion of how to use the `L`
and `U` suffixes with integer constants).

### Solution
