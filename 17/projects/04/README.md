### Exercise 17.04

Modify the `justify` program of Section 15.3 by rewriting the `line.c` file so
that it stores the current line in a linked list. Each node in the list will
store a single word. The `line` array will be replaced by a variable that points
to the node containing the first word. This variable will store a null pointer
whenever the line is empty.

### Solution

See program files.
