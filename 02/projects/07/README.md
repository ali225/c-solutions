### Project 2.07
Write a program that asks the user to enter a U.S. dollar amount and then shows
how to pay that amount using the smallest number of $20, $10, $5 and $1 bills:

```
Enter a dollar amount: 93

$20 bills: 4
$10 bills: 1
 $5 bills: 0
 $1 bills: 3
```

*Hint*: Divide the amount by 20 to determine the number of $20 bills needed, and
then reduce the amount by the total value of the $20 bills. Repeat for the
other bill sizes. Be sure to use integer values throughout, not floating-point
numbers.

### Solution
See `7.c`.
