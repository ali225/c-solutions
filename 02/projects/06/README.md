### Project 2.06
Modify the program of Programming Project 5 so that the polynomial is evaluated
using the following formula:

((((3x + 2)x-5)x-1)x+7)x-6

Note that the modified program performs fewer multiplications. This technique
for evaluating polynomials is known as ***Horner's Rule***.

### Solution
See `6.c`.
