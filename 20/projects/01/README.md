### Project 20.01

Design a union that makes it possible to view a 32-bit value as either a `float`
or the structure described in Exercise 14. Write a program that stores 1 in the
structure's sign field, 128 in the exponent field and 0 in the fraction field,
then prints the `float` value stored in the union (The answer should be -2.0 if
you've set up the bit-fields correctly).

### Solution

See `1.c`.
