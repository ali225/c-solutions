### Exercise 19.04

(a) Write an implementation of the `Stack` type, assuming that `Stack` is a
structure containing a fixed-length array.

(b) Redo the `Stack` type, this time using a linked-list representation instead
of an array. (Show both `stack.h` and `stack.c`)

### Solution

#### (a)

See `stack.c` and `stack.h`.

#### (b)

See `stack2.c` and `stack.h`.
