### Exercise 19.01

A **queue** is similar to a stack, except that items are added at one end but
removed from the other in a **FIFO** (first-in, first-out) fashion). Operations
on a queue might include:

    Inserting an item at the end of the queue  
    Removing an item from the beginning of the queue  
    Returning the first item in the queue (without changing the queue)  
    Returning the last item in the queue (without changing the queue)  
    Testing whether the queue is empty

Write an interface for a queue module in the form of a header file named
`queue.h`.

### Solution

See `queue.h`.
