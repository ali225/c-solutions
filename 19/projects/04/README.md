### Project 19.04

Modify the `stackADT.h` and `stackADT3.c` files of Section 19.4 so that a stack
stores values of type `void *`, as described in Section 19.5: the `Item` type
will no longer be used. Modify `stackclient.c` so that it stores pointers to
strings in the `s1` and `s2` stacks.

### Solution

See program files.
