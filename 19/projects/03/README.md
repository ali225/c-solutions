### Project 19.03

Modify the `stackADT3.c` file of Section 19.4 by adding an `int` member named
`len` to the `stack_type` structure. This member will keep track of how many
items are currently stored in a stack. Add a new function named `length` that
has a `Stack` parameter and returns the value of the `len` member (Some of the
existing functions in `stackADT3.c` will need to be modified as well). Modify
`stackclient.c` so that it calls the `length` function (and displays the value
that it returns) after each operation that modifies a stack.

### Solution

See program files.
