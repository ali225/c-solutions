### Project 4.01
Write a program that asks the user to enter a two-digit number, then prints the
number with its digits reversed. A session with the program should have the
following appearance:

```
Enter a two-digit number: 28
The reversal is: 82
```

Read the number using `%d`, then break it into two digits. *Hint*: If `n` is an
integer, then `n % 10` is the last digit in `n` and `n / 10` is `n` with the
last digit removed.

### Solution
See `1.c`.
