### Project 6.11
The value of the mathematical constant e can be expressed as an infinite series:

e = 1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + ...

Write a program that approximates e by computing the value of 

1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! + ... + 1/n!

where n is an integer entered by the user.

### Solution
See `11.c`.
