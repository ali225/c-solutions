### Project 6.10
Programming Project 9 in Chapter 5 asked you to write a program that determines
which of two dates comes earlier on the calendar. Generalize the program so that
the user may enter any number of dates. The user will enter 0/0/0 to indicate
that no more dates will be entered:

```
Enter a date (mm/dd/yy): 3/6/08
Enter a date (mm/dd/yy): 5/17/07
Enter a date (mm/dd/yy): 6/3/07
Enter a date (mm/dd/yy): 0/0/0
5/17/07 is the earliest date
```

### Solution
See `10.c`.
