### Project 6.01
Write a program that finds the largest in a series of numbers entered by the
user. The program must prompt the user to enter numbers one by one, When the
user enters 0 or a negative number, the program must display the largest
nonnegative number entered:

```
Enter a number: 60
Enter a number: 38.3
Enter a number: 4.89
Enter a number: 100.62
Enter a number: 75.2295
Enter a number: 0

The largest number entered was 100.62
```

Notice that the numbers aren't necessarily integers.
