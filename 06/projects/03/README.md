### Project 6.03
Write a program that asks the user to enter a fraction, then reduces the
fraction to lowest terms:

```
Enter a fraction: 6/12
In lowest terms: 1/2
```

*Hint*: To reduce a fraction to lowest terms, first compute the GCD of the
numberator and denominator. Then divide both the numerator and denominator by
the GCD.

### Solution
See `3.c`.
