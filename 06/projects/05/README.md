### Project 6.05
Programming Project 1 in Chapter 4 asked you to write a program that displays a
two-digit number with its digits reversed. Generalize the program so that the
number can have one, two, three, or more digits. *Hint*: Use a `do` loop that
repeatedly divides the number by 10, stopping when it reaches 0.

### Solution
See `5.c`.
