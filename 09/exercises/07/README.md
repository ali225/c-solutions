### Exercise 9.07
Suppose that the function `f` has the following definition:

`int f(int a, int b) {` ... `}`

Which of the following statements are legal? Assume that `i` has type `int` and
`x` has type `double`.

(a) `i = f(83, 12);`  
(b) `x = f(83, 12);`  
(c) `i = f(3.15, 9.28);`  
(d) `x = f(3.15, 9.28);`  
(e) `f(83, 12);`

### Solution

All of the statements are legal.
