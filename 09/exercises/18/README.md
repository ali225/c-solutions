### Exercise 9.18
Write a recursive version of the `gcd` function (see Exercise 3). Here's the
strategy to use for computing `gcd(m, n)`: If `n` is 0, return `m`. Otherwise,
call `gcd` recursively, passing `n` as the first argument and `m % n` as the
second.

### Solution

```c
int gcd(int m, int n) {

    return n == 0 ? m : gcd(n, m % n);
}
```
