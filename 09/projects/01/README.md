### Project 9.01
Write a program that asks the user to enter a series of integers (which it
stores in an array), then sorts the integers by calling the function
`selection_sort`. When given an array with *n* elements, `selection_sort` must
do the following:
    1. Search the array to find the largest element, then move it to the last
    position in the array.  
    2. Call itself recursively to sort the first *n* - 1 elements of the array.

### Solution

See `1.c`.
