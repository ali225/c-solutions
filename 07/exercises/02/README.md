### Exercise 7.02
Which of the following are not legal constants in C? Classify each legal
constant as either integer or floating-point.

(a) `010E2`  
(b) `32.1E+5`  
(c) `0790`  
(d) `100_000`  
(e) `3.987e-2`

### Solution

(c) and (d) are illegal constants, because of undefined numeral `9` in octal
number `0790`, and underscore in `100_000`.

(a), (b) and (e) are legal, floating point constants.
