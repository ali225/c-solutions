### Project 7.04
Write a program that translates an alphabetic phone number into numeric form:

```
Enter phone number: CALLATT
2255288
```

(In case you don't have a telephone nearby, here are the letters on the keys:
2=ABC, 3=DEF, 4=GHI, 5=JKL, 6=MNO, 7=PRS, 8=TUV, 9=WXY.) If the original phone
number contains nonalphabetic characters (digits or punctuation, for example),
leave them unchanged:

```
Enter phone number: 1-800-COL-LECT
1-800-265-5328
```

You may assums that any letteres entered by the user are upper case.

### Solution
See `4.c`.
