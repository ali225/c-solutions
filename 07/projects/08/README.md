### Project 7.08
Modify Programming Project 8 from Chapter 5 so that the user enters a time using
the 12-hour clock. The input will have the form *hours*:*minutes* followed by
either `A`, `P`, `AM` or `PM` (either lower-case or upper-case). White space is
allowed (but not required) between the numerical time and the AM/PM indicator.
Examples of valid input:

```
1:15P
1:15PM
1:15p
1:15pm
1:15 P
1:15 PM
1:15 p
1:15 pm
```

You may assume that the input has one of these forms; there is no need to test
for errors.

### Solution
See `8.c`.
