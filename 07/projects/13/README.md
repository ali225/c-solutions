### Project 7.13
Write a program that calculates the average word length for a sentence:

```
Enter a sentence: It was deja vu all over again.
Average word length: 3.4
```

For simplicity, your program should consider a punctuation mark to be part of
the word to which it is attached. Display the average word length to one decimal
place.

### Solution
See `13.c`.
