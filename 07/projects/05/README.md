### Project 7.05
In the SCRABBLE Crossword Game, players form words using small tiles, each
containing a letter and a face value. The face value varies from one letter to
another, based on the letter's rarity. (Here are the face values: 1: AEILNORSTU,
2: DG, 3: BCMP, 4: FHVWY, 5: K, 8: JX, 10: QZ.) Write a program that computes
the value of a word by summing the values of its letters:

```
Enter a word: pitfall
Scrabble value: 12
```

Your program should allow any mixture of lower-case and upper-case letters in
the word. *Hint*: Use the `toupper` library function.

### Solution
See `5.c`.
