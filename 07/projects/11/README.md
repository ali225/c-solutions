### Project 7.11
Write a program that takes a first name and a last name entered by the user and
displays the last name, a comma, and the first initial, followed by a period:

```
Enter a first and last name: Lloyd Fosdick
Fodsick, L.
```

The user's input may contain extre spaces before the first name, between the
first and last names, and after the last name.

### Solution
