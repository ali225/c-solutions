### Project 7.02
Modify the `square2.c` program of Section 6.3 so that it pauses after every 24
squares and displays the following message:

`Press Enter to continue...`

After displaying the message, the program should use `getchar` to read a
character. `getchar` won't allow the program to continue until the user pressed
the Enter key.

### Solution
See `2.c`.
