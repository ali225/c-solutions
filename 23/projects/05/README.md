### Project 23.05

Suppose that money is deposited into a savings account and left for *t* years.
Assume that the annual interest rate is *r* and that interest is compounded
continuously. The formula *A*(*t*) = *Pe*<sup>*rt*</sup> can be used to
calculate the final value of the account, where *P* is the original amount
deposited. For example, $1000 left on deposit for 10 years at 6% interest would
be worth $1000 x *e*<sup>.06 x 10</sup> = $1000 x *e*<sup>.6</sup> = $1000 x
1.8221188 = $1,822.12. Write a program that displays the result of this
calculation after prompting the user to enter the original amount deposited, the
interest rate and the number of years.

### Solution

See `5.c`.
