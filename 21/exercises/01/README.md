### Exercise 21.01

Locate where header files are kept on your system. Find the nonstandard headers
and determine the purpose of each.

### Solution

In locations `/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/7.2.1/include`,
`/usr/local/include`, `/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/7.2.1/include-fixed` and
`/usr/include`, there are over seven hundred `.h` files, some of which are also
used in C++ header files. A complete list of `.h` files on my system can be
found on `include.txt`. The list is too comprehensive to rightly find
definitions for each non-standard header.
