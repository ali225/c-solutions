### Project 12.01
#### (a)
Write a program that reads a message, then prints the reversal of the message:

```
Enter a message: Don't get mad, get even.
Reversal is: .neve teg ,dam teg t'noD
```

*Hint*: Read the message one character at a time (using `getchar`) and store the
characters in an array. Stop reading when the array is full or the character
read is `'\n'`.

#### (b)
Revise the program to use a pointer instead of an integer to keep track of the
current position in the array.

### Solution
See `1.c`.
