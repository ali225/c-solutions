### Project 13.02

Improve the `remind.c` program of Section 13.5 in the following ways:

(a) Have the program print an error message and ignore a remainder if the
corresponding day is negative or larger than 31. *Hint*: Use a `continue`
statement.  
(b) Allow the user to enter a day, a 24-hour time and a reminder. The printed
reminder list should be sorted first by day, then by time. (The original program
allows the user to enter a time, but it's treated as part of the reminder.)  
(c) Have the program print a one-*year* reminder list. Require the user to enter
the days in the form *month/day*.

### Solution
See `2.c`.
