### Project 13.05

Write a program named `sum.c` that adds up its command-line arguments, which are
assumed to be integers. Running the program by typing

```
sum 8 24 62
```

should produce the following output:

```
Total: 94
```

*Hint*: Use the `atoi` function to convert each command-line argument from
string form to integer form.

### Solution

See `sum.c`.
