### Project 13.10

Modify Programming Project 11 from Chapter 7 so that it includes the following
function:

```c
void reverse_name(char *name);
```

The unction expects `name` to point to a string containing a first name followed
by a last name. It modifies the string so that the last name comes first,
followed by a comma, a space, the first initial and a period. The original
string may contain extra spaces before the first name, between the first and
last names and after the last name.

### Solution

See `10.c`.
