### Project 26.02

Write a program that tests the `atexit` function. The program should have two
functions (in addition to `main`), one of which prints `That's all, ` and the
other `folks!`. Use the `atexit` function to register both to be called at
program termination. Make sure they're called in the proper order so that we see
the message `That's call, folks!` on the screen.

### Solution

See `2.c`.
