### Project 3.05
Write a program that asks the user to enter the numbers from 1 to 16 (in any
order) and then displays the numbers in a 4 by 4 arrangement, followed by the
sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals:

```
Enter the numbers from 1 to 16 in any order:
16 3 2 13 5 10 11 8 9 6 7 12 4 15 14 1

16  3  2 13
 5 10 11  8
 9  6  7 12
 4 15 14  1

Row sums: 34 34 34 34
Column sums: 34 34 34 34
Diagonal sums: 34 34
```

If the row, column, and diagonal sums are all the same (as they are in this
example), the numbers are said to form a *magic square*. The magic square shown
here appears in a 1514 engraving by artist and mathematician Albrecht DÃ¼rer.
(Note that the middle numbers in the last row give the date of engraving.)

### Solution
See `5.c`.
