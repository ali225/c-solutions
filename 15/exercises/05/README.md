### Exercise 15.05

Suppose that a program consists of three source files -- `main.c`, `f1.c` and
`f2.c` -- plus two header files, `f1.h` and `f2.h`. All three source files
include `f1.h`, but only `f1.c` and `f2.c` include `f2.h`. Write a makefile for
this program, assuming that the compiler is `gcc` and that the executable file
is to be named `demo`.

### Solution

See `makefile`.
